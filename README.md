# TDD101
Welcome to the repo for our TDD meetup! Guests can choose to code in Python, .NET, or Java. We have provided instructions for setting up the development environment for each language as well as FizzBuzz starter projects. We will also have a USB drive that will have the files needed for an install on mac and windows but highly encourage people to come already prepared. The USB Drive will also have a clone of this repo on it in case internet access is an issue.
