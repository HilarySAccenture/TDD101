# TDD101
Welcome to the repo for our TDD meetup! Guests can choose to code in Python, .NET, or Java. We have provided instructions for setting up the development environment for each language as well as FizzBuzz starter projects. We will also have a USB drive that will have the files needed for an install on mac and windows but highly encourage people to come already prepared. The USB Drive will also have a clone of this repo on it in case internet access is an issue.

# Instructions #

FizzBuzz is a simple number game in which you count, but replace certain numbers with the words "Fizz" and/or "Buzz", adhering to certain rules.

1. Create a FizzBuzz() method that prints out the numbers 1 through 100, separated by newlines.
2. Instead of numbers divisible by 3, the method should output "Fizz".
3. Instead of numbers divisible by 5, the method should output "Buzz".
4. Instead of numbers divisible by 3 and 5, the method should output "FizzBuzz".

## Sample Output ##
    1
    2
    Fizz
    4
    Buzz
    Fizz
    7
    8
    Fizz
    Buzz
    11
    Fizz
    13
    14
    FizzBuzz
    16
    
# Bonus points #
Divisible by 2 returns Bazz sooâ€¦
Divisible by 2 and 3 = FizzBazz
Divisible by 2 and 3 and 5 = FizzBazzBuzz
Can accept an array of numbers 1-100 and returns an array of the output
